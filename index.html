            <h4>JANASENA PARTY SYMBOL</h4>
            <img src="image.1/jenasena.webp"width="200"height="200">
            <p> <h4>Formation</h4>
                On 14 March 2014, Konidela Pawan Kalyan applied to register the party name.[6] Kalyan formally launched the party at the HITEC City business district in Madhapur, Hyderabad, on 14 March with a massive meeting.[5][7] This was followed by another public gathering and meeting in Vizag where he launched his book Ism. The party was approved by the Election Commission on 11 December 2014.[8]
                <h4>2014 elections</h4>
Jana Sena supported BJP and TDP in the 2014 general and assembly elections. Kalyan campaigned in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Karnataka addressing the public along with Narendra Modi and N. Chandrababu Naidu, who later won the elections and became Prime Minister of India and Chief Minister of AP, respectively. He opposed Congress rule stating the slogan, Congress Hatao Desh Bachao. His rallies drew what the Deccan-Journal called "huge crowds" in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Pawan Kalyan was invited to Parliament Central Hall to attend NDA meeting and attended the swearing-in ceremony of Naidu.
                <h4>Post 2019 Elections and BJP alliance</h4>
Jana Sena announced that tying up with Bharatiya Janata Party in Andhra Pradesh, this decision came after Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy's intention to decentralise the capital, instead of developing Amaravati.[23][24][25]
                <h4>2023 Varahi Yatra</h4>
In 2023, Janasena President Pawan Kalyan undertook a tour in the state on a vehicle named Varahi aimed at highlighting the failures of the Jagan Mohan Reddy government. The vehicle used for the trip is a camper van having facilities like bed, cooking equipment, wash room etc.[26] The tour also includes the Janavani programme where the party receives petitions from people seeking redressal of their grievances. Later, the grievances will be taken to the notice of the authorities concerned to get them redressed.[7]

The first phase of the yatra started with darshan at Annavaram Satyanarayana Swamy temple on 14 June and was drawn to a close at Bhimavaram on June 30.[4] Pawan Kalyan toured Prathipadu, Pithapuram, Kakinada urban and rural, Mummidivaram, Amalapuram, P. Gannavaram, Narasapuram, Razole, Palakollu and Bhimavaram constituencies in the first phase.[4] The second phase of the Varahi Yatra began with a public meeting in Eluru town on July 9.[6]
